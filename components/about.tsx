        <p className='mb-3'>After successfully completing my Diploma in Nautical Science from Myanmar Mercantile Marine College, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I studied full-stack web development from online courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB and other utility libraries. Although I learned PHP and Laravel, I haven&apos;t dedicated as much time to them. I&apos;m currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.</p>
        <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar, listening to music, walking, reading, and playing football. I also like learning about philosophy, psychology, and mathematics.
